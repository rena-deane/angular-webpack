#Angular with Webpack

Angular with Webpack can be used as a template for any Angular project built using Webpack.  I used Nir Kaufman's [Angular With Webpack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3PNhMk4MWg) talk (in Hebrew) as a guide to building this template.

NOTE: I don't speak Hebrew but if want to get a basic undestanding of Webpack I highly recommend this video. [Webpack Documentation](https://webpack.github.io/) helps as well.

## AngularJS

Is this your first time using AngularJS?  I recommend [Shaping Up With Angular](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js) by [Code School](https://codeschool.com/).

## Run the App

Requires node.  Once you have cloned the project, install the dependencies:

```
npm i
```

To test that everything is working enter

```
npm run dev 
````
This script runs the `webpack-dev-server` on `localhost:8080`


<strong>YOU'RE READY TO GO</strong>
