#NG-WEBPACK-SASS

NG-WEBPACK-SASS can be used as a template for any Angular project.  I used Nir Kaufman's [Angular With Webpack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3PNhMk4MWg) talk (in Hebrew) as a guide to building this template.

###Webpack
If you want to get a basic understanding of Webpack I highly recommend this video
[Webpack Documentation](https://webpack.github.io/) helps as well.

###Sass
`./src/main.scss` is bundled into `bundle.js`.  Read [documentation](http://sass-lang.com/) for more on Sass.

## AngularJS

Is this your first time using AngularJS?  I recommend [Shaping Up With Angular](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/shaping-up-with-angular-js) by [Code School](https://codeschool.com/).

## Run the App

```
npm i
```

To test that everything is working enter

```
npm run dev
````
This script runs the `webpack-dev-server` on `localhost:8080`


<strong>YOU'RE READY TO GO</strong>
